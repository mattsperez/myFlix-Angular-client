# **MyFlixAngularClient**
### **Objective :**
_Using Angular, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based onits existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting documentation._

### **Key Features of App**
* Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an
account.
* Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.
* Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where
additional movie details will be displayed. The single movie view will contain the following
additional features:
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the
director of that particular movie will be displayed.
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that
particular genre of the movie will be displayed
